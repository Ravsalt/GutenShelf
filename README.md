## About GutenShelf

GutenShelf is a free and open-source online book library dedicated to democratizing access to knowledge. It offers a seamless experience for discovering and reading books, built with a focus on user experience, performance, and accessibility.

## Features

- **Vast Library**: Access a wide range of classics, bestsellers, and hidden gems.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design for seamless browsing and reading.
- **Free & Open Source**: No ads, no paywalls, open for contributions.

## Project Structure

GutenShelf is organized as a monorepo with the following key directories:

- `client/`: The React frontend application.
- `server/`: The Hono backend API.
- `shared/`: Contains shared TypeScript definitions used by both client and server.

### Server

GutenShelf uses Hono as its backend API, handling book data and search queries.

### Client

The client is built with Vite and React, providing a flexible and modern frontend for the application.

### Shared

This package contains TypeScript definitions and other utilities shared between the client and server.
