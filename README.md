├── server/               # Hono backend for GutenShelf
├── shared/               # Shared TypeScript definitions for GutenShelf
│   └── src/types/        # Type definitions used by both client and server

```

### Server

GutenShelf uses Hono as a backend API for its simplicity and massive ecosystem of plugins. It handles book data, search queries, and other server-side operations.

If you wanted to add a database to Hono you can do so with a multitude of Typescript libraries like [Supabase](https://supabase.com), or ORMs like [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/get-started) or [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/orm)

### Client

bhvr uses Vite + React Typescript template, which means you can build your frontend just as you would with any other React app. This makes it flexible to add UI components like [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) or routing using [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/start/declarative/installation).

export default App
```

### Shared

The Shared package is used for anything you want to share between the Server and Client. This could be types or libraries that you use in both the enviorments.

```
shared
├── package.json
├── src
│   ├── index.ts
│   └── types
│       └── index.ts
└── tsconfig.json
```

Inside the `src/index.ts` we export any of our code from the folders so it's usabe in other parts of the monorepo

```typescript
export * from "./types"
```

By running `bun run dev` or `bun run build` it will compile and export the packages from `shared` so it can be used in either `client` or `server`

```typescript
import { ApiResponse } from 'shared'
```

## Getting Started

### Quick Start

You can start a new bhvr project using the [CLI](https://github.com/stevedylandev/create-bhvr)

```bash
bun create bhvr
```

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies for all workspaces
bun install
```

### Development

```bash
# Run shared types in watch mode, server, and client all at once
bun run dev

# Or run individual parts
bun run dev:shared  # Watch and compile shared types
bun run dev:server  # Run the Hono backend
bun run dev:client  # Run the Vite dev server for React
```

### Building

```bash
# Build everything
bun run build

# Or build individual parts
bun run build:shared  # Build the shared types package
bun run build:client  # Build the React frontend
```

### Deployment

Deplying each piece is very versatile and can be done numerous ways, and exploration into automating these will happen at a later date. Here are some references in the meantime.

- [Netlify](https://vite.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#netlify)
- [Cloudflare Pages](https://vite.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#cloudflare-pages)

**Server**

- [Node.js](https://hono.dev/docs/getting-started/nodejs)

## Type Sharing

Types are automatically shared between the client and server thanks to the shared package and TypeScript path aliases. You can import them in your code using:

```typescript
import { ApiResponse } from '@shared/types';
```
